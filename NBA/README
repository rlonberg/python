run the script, getNBA.py

Part of a larger iOS project I am currently developing, getNBA.py does a simple task: fetches the NBA schedule for today and tomorrow, giving you the matchups and the vegas lines/predictions for each matchup.

getNBA.py uses Game.py, make sure that both are in the same directory when executing getNBA.py
